## 

-   Hurricane frequency
-   How many storms? Are they becoming more common?
-   Count data vs measured data
-   Analyzing and modeling hurricane frequency
-   No class this Wednesday (March 22)
-   Lab 4 next Monday (March 27)

## 

-   Hurricane season maps

![Map showing the tracks and intensities of all the tropical cyclones over the North Atlantic basin during the 1950 hurricane season](https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/data/tracks/tracks-at-1950.png)

##

-   Where can you find data on past Atlantic hurricanes?
    - <https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/data/>
    - <https://www.aoml.noaa.gov/hrd/hurdat/Data_Storm.html>

## {.smaller}

-   The file `NATL_Counts.txt` in the folder `data` contains annual counts of tropical storms, hurricanes, and major hurricanes across the North Atlantic basin back to 1851
-   Click on it. Get these data into your current R session

```{r, message=FALSE}
#| echo: true
Counts.df <- readr::read_table(file = here::here("data", "NATL_Counts.txt"))

Counts.df |>
  head()
```

-   `TS` number of tropical storms (wind of at least 17 m/s, 33 kt, 40 mph)
-   `H` number of hurricanes (wind of at least 33 m/s, 64 kt, 75 mph)
-   `MH` number of major hurricanes (wind of at least 50 m/s, 97 kt, 111 mph)
-   wind refer to the maximum sustained (1 minute) at a height of 10 m above the surface (land or ocean)

## 

-   Write code to determine the average number of major hurricanes per year
```{r}
Counts.df |>
  dplyr::summarize(Avg = mean(MH))

mean(Counts.df$MH)
```

-   Write code to determine what year had the most hurricanes
```{r}
Counts.df |>
  dplyr::arrange(desc(H))
```


## {.smaller}

-   Count data is different than measured data
-   Annual average number of hurricanes vs annual average temperature
-   Write code to list the hurricane counts

```{r}
#| echo: true
Counts.df |>
  dplyr::pull(H)
```

-   Big swings from one year to the next

## 
-   Use the `table()` function on the hurricane counts to get the distribution of counts by year

```{r}
#| echo: true
Counts.df |>
  dplyr::pull(H) |>
  table()
```

-   How do you interpret this output?
-   What count is most common? How many years without a hurricane? How many years had at least 12 hurricanes?

##
-   What is the average count? What is the variance in the counts? What is the ratio of the variance in the the counts to the average count?
-   These questions are answered with the following code

```{r}
#| echo: true
Counts.df |>
  dplyr::summarize(NYears = dplyr::n(),
                   Avg = mean(H),
                   Var = var(H),
                   Ratio = Var/Avg)
```

-   Observations versus statistics
-   Descriptive versus inferential statistics

## {.smaller}

-   Create a graph displaying the distribution of counts

```{r}
#| echo: true
library(ggplot2)

ggplot(data = Counts.df,
       mapping = aes(x = H)) +
  geom_bar(color = "gray") +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = 0:15)
```

-   Right skewed and bounded on the left by zero
-   Compare with distribution of daily high temperatures in Tallahassee

## {.smaller}

-   Random number generator
-   172 random values from a normal distribution with a average of 180 and a standard deviation of 15

```{r}
rnorm(n = 172, mean = 180, sd = 150)
```

## {.smaller}

-   172 random counts from a Poisson distribution with an average equal to the average annual number of hurricanes

```{r}
#| echo: true
( H1 <- rpois(n = 172, lambda = 6) )
```

```{r}
#| echo: true
H1 |>
  table()
```

-   A model for the counts
-   Uncertainty: aleatory and epistemic

##

-   The observed counts are a bit unusual relative to the modeled counts in two ways
-   Greater variance (dispersion) and serial correlation
-   The chance that a random set of counts has a greater dispersion

```{r}
#| echo: true
Ratio <- NULL
for(i in 1:10000){
  H <- rpois(n = 172, lambda = 5.55)
  Ratio <- c(Ratio, var(H)/mean(H)) 
}
sum(Ratio > 1.22) / 10000 * 100
```

##

-   Does the count in one year tell you anything about the count in the next year? Autocorrelation

```{r}
#| echo: true
Counts.df$H |>
  acf()
```

##

-   How does the autocorrelation compare with a random set of counts?

```{r}
#| echo: true
rpois(n = 172, lambda = 5.55) |>
  acf()
```

## {.smaller}

-   Change over the years in the number of hurricanes
-   Observed vs modeled

```{r}
#| echo: true
df <- data.frame(Year = rep(Counts.df$Year, times = 2),
                 Counts = rep(c("Observed", "Modeled"), each = 172),
                 H = c(Counts.df$H, rpois(n = 172, lambda = 5.55)))
ggplot(data = df,
       mapping = aes(x = Year, y = H, color = Counts)) +
  geom_line() +
  geom_smooth(method = lm)
```

##

-   Quantify the increase

```{r}
#| echo: true
lm(H ~ Year, data = Counts.df)
```

-   An increase of .015 hurricanes per year or .015 * 172 = 2.6 more hurricanes on average today than in 1851

## Major hurricanes

-   Summary statistics

```{r}
#| echo: true
Counts.df |>
  dplyr::summarize(NYears = dplyr::n(),
                   Avg = mean(MH),
                   Var = var(MH),
                   Ratio = Var/Avg)
```

##

-   Distribution of the number of major hurricanes by year

```{r}
#| echo: true
ggplot(data = Counts.df,
       mapping = aes(x = MH)) +
  geom_bar(color = "gray") +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = 0:8)
```

##

-   Change in the number of major hurricanes over the years

```{r}
#| echo: true

ggplot(data = Counts.df,
       mapping = aes(x = Year, y = MH)) +
  geom_col() +
  geom_smooth(method = glm, 
              method.args = list(family = 'poisson'),
              se = FALSE)
```

##

-   Quantify the increase
-   Using Poisson regression

```{r}
glm(MH ~ Year, data = Counts.df, family = poisson)
```

.0074 or .74% increase per year. Over 172 years and starting with 1 MH in 1851 you compute 1 * (1 + .00745)^172 = 3.6 MH in 2022

## 

-   How well can hurricane counts be predicted from ocean temperature and ENSO?
-   Get the data (annual hurricane counts, SST, ENSO) and collate the observations
-   <https://psl.noaa.gov/data/climateindices/list/>

```{r}
#| echo: true
ENSO.df <- readr::read_table(file = here::here("data", "CENSO.txt"))
SST.df <- readr::read_table(file = here::here("data", "TNA_SST.txt"))
Counts.df <- readr::read_table(file = here::here("data", "NATL_Counts.txt")) |>
  dplyr::filter(Year >= 1948)

df <- data.frame(Year = Counts.df$Year,
                 H = Counts.df$H,
                 MH = Counts.df$MH,
                 SST = (SST.df$Aug + SST.df$Sep + SST.df$Oct)/3,
                 ENSO = (ENSO.df$Aug + ENSO.df$Sep + ENSO.df$Oct)/3)
```

##

-   Poisson regression model

```{r}
#| echo: true
model <- glm(H ~ SST + ENSO, 
             data = df,
             family = poisson)
```

-   Prediction grid

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| output-location: slide
grd <- expand.grid(SST = seq(-.5, .85, .01), 
                   ENSO = seq(-2.5, 2.8, .1))
z <- predict(model, newdata = grd, type = "response")
grd$H <- z
ggplot(data = grd,
       mapping = aes(x = SST, y = ENSO, fill = H)) + 
        geom_tile() +
        scale_fill_viridis_c(limits = c(0, 15), option = "inferno") +
        labs(fill = "Rate") +
        xlab("Atlantic Sea Surface Temperature (Â°C)") + 
        ylab("ENSO Index (s.d.)") +
        ggtitle(label = "Annual Atlantic hurricane rate") +
        theme_minimal()
```

## 

-   Your turn
-   Annual U.S. counts

```{r, message=FALSE}
Counts.df <- readr::read_table(file = here::here("data", "CONUS_Counts.txt"))

Counts.df |>
  head()
```

-   Total (`CONUS`), major (`MUS`), Gulf (`G`), Florida (`FL`), East Coast (`E`)

-   Write code to determine the average number of Gulf hurricanes per year
-   Write code to determine what year had the most Florida hurricanes
